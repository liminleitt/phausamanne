==============================================

**sklearn-xarray** is an open-source python package that combines the
n-dimensional labeled arrays of xarray with the machine learning and model
selection tools of scikit-learn. The package contains wrappers that allow the
user to apply scikit-learn estimators to xarray types without losing their
labels.
